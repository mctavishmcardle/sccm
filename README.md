# `sccm`: Solid Component (& Constraint\*) Modeling
> \* (constraint-based modeling coming before version `1.0`)

`sccm` is a `python` toolkit for solid modelling CAD - it aims to replicate a
workflow similar to one familiar to users of `Fusion 360` (in some ways) while
leveraging the flexibility & power of sourcecode-based object definition. It uses
`OpenSCAD` as its rendering and interactive engine: objects in `sccm` can be
rendered to `OpenSCAD` code, which itself can be rendered visually.
